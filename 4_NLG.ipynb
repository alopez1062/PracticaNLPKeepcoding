We\\'re taking the HardChoices book tour across the pond!pic.twitter.com/0xjk8DEmp5 Hard-working women will pay the price for today\\'s two troubling SCOTUS decisions -- in wages, health care & dignity. Heartbreaking news: a vital voice for justice is silenced.  ... . Well thats not a Hard Choice. You already did! Keep letting us hear you Roar. I came across this photo this morning and saw others sharing it, thought I would too. MayaAngeloupic.twitter.com/MVDuSDpAdN I will miss my friend MayaAngelou. Truly a PhenomenalWoman. Meriam Yahya Ibrahims death sentence is abhorrent. Sudan should stop threatening religious freedom and fundamental human rights. In Little Rock today with Dale and Leslie Chihuly for the opening of his spectacular new exhibit  Access to education is a basic right & an unconscionable reason to target innocent girls. We must stand up to terrorism. BringBackOurGirls .   Great day launching TalkingIsTeachingTulsa.  And, I made some new friends:pic.twitter.com/bX7OmEofSO Today  MT   3 Clintons & a Kimmel   selfiepic.twitter.com/YsJP8iNqCj Great to be back in Arizona with  &  at CGIU. Looking forward to the weekend  The freedom to speak out & to connect is a fundamental right. The people of Turkey deserve that right restored. TwitterisblockedinTurkey . SecGen Ban Ki-moon  great to see you for  yesterday. Watch here:  ...pic.twitter.com/cxrVHj2DQH For IWD2014, I celebrate the work of Eleanor Roosevelt, a courageous advocate for human rights. Her work continues to inspire. NoCeilings Some encouraging news today from China\\'s business leaders on stopping the demand for ivory.  ... Some of the team from Beijing \\'95 who declared women\\'s rights are human rights. Great reunion today, more work to do.pic.twitter.com/aMfaWKyRCp Headed in from Chappaqua on this snowy morning to talk to  about why data is so important for women and girls.  NoCeilings Its so much more fun to watch FOX when its someone else being blitzed & sacked! SuperBowl As a teenager I saw MLK speak in Chicago & shook his hand. He urged us to stay engaged with the cause of justice. As vital as ever today. 1 in 3 women live at or on the brink of poverty in the US. 28 million children depend on them.     So pleased & proud to see Mayor  sworn in today. MT  What a great day for NYC!pic.twitter.com/VLYwpbIw5M 10 years ago I was proud to begin working on bipartisan efforts to save unemployment insurance. Let\\'s do it again quickly in this new year. Merry XMas & Happy New Year x 1,002,958. Thinking about the millions who face challenges everyday. Looking forward to 2014. So much to do. What happens to kids in families cut from unemployment insurance & food stamps? Theyre 2SmallToFail, & deserve an equal chance to succeed. Just landed in NY. The Ukrainian government must follow Madiba\\'s example & choose dialogue with its people, not force. Nelson Mandela was a champion for justice & human dignity, with unmatched grace. I\\'ll remember him as Madiba, truly an unconquerable soul. Backstage with  at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards.  What an incredible woman.pic.twitter.com/edjNP4zXo6 As a mom, I made reading to  a priority every night. New studies show us the importance of words:   Here at CDF40. My advocacy for children began with Marian Wright Edelman, it continues w/  8 African nations, 16 NGOs, $80 million, and a path to end elephant poaching.  and I are thrilled!   So proud of what we\\'ve done and so much more to do. Join me. Beijing+20 Something I didn\\'t know until I read her new bio this AM: Secretary Albright plays the drums. Welcome to Twitter  See you at CGI! Great 1st meeting with  Leadership & Advisory Council yesterday. Here\\'s some good reading on the issue:  . look familiar? Not Hogwarts but beautiful St Andrews! Thanks to grad student Claire for the grand tourpic.twitter.com/cuOxYry7yt Flying to 112 countries is a lot until you consider swimming between 2. Feels like I swim with sharks - but you actually did it! Congrats! I can\\'t believe he turned 67 today.  He doesn\\'t look a day over four...  Bill wrote a wonderful letter about BHCCF work. So proud of what\\'s been accomplished, I know the best is yet to come.   . tweet and ye shall receive.  And I see that you\\'re a fellow Downton Abbey fan.  Birds of a feather it would seem! Bill & Chelsea are back from a great BH&CCF trip to Africa, just in time for Bill\\'s big news from POTUS:  Congratulations from across the pond to the Duke and Duchess! Wishing you the best of luck and a bit of advice: It Takes a (Royal) Village! Seneca Falls, 165 years ago today, began a movement that remains the unfinished business of the 21st century.   Today Im reminded of Invictus, a poem Mandela used to recite in prison. You\\'re truly an \"unconquerable soul\" Madiba. Happy 95th Birthday. Went to Central Pk Zoo to meet w/wildlife experts about elephants. Their solution: Stop the Killing - Stop the Trafficking - Stop the Demand Malala today at the UN: Nothing changed in my life except this-weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Extraordinary young woman. MalalaDay . at Bryn Mawr was so inspiring. Women in public sector jobs: 50% by 2050. That\\'s the goal.pic.twitter.com/8xp0ggoKT8 I applaud all the hard work of everyone who worked so tirelessly to make today possible.   I am disappointed in today\\'s decision striking at the heart of the Voting Rights Act.   Bill, Cheslea & I have sent our love and prayers to our great friend, Madiba, his family and his nation during this difficult time. Having so much fun with Chelsea, taking selfies back stage. MT:   . is my new effort w/  to help our kids in their crucial early years. We can all act:   What an incredible Twitter welcome! In my hometown Chicago for CGIAmerica. 11amET I\\'ll talk about my BHCCF   Thanks for the inspiration  &  - I\\'ll take it from here... tweetsfromhillary'"

De todas formas aunque un accuracy de 0,5 pueda parecer muy bajo, hay que tener en cuenta que el vocabulario eran 88 caracteres, es decir, sobre 88 posibilidades acierta el 50% de las veces. Visto así puede que no sea tan malo. En cualquier caso vamos aprobarlo prediciendo texto sobre frases reales a ver como se comporta."
